This project was originally created as a University of Wyoming ENGL4025 final project.

There's a pretty uncool gender equality problem in Computer Science. We interviewed a few Computer Science undergrads and built a single page website to push more young women into Computer Science (and programming in general).

This isn't very mobile optimized, unfortuantely, and my CSS skills are a bit rusty. It looks great on most desktops, though!

To run:

1. Install Ruby 2.3.3.
2. ```gem install bundler```
3. ```bundle```
3. ```gem install rerun```
4. ```rerun ruby app.rb```

You'll see something like this:

```
== Sinatra (v1.4.7) has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from Thin
Thin web server (v1.6.4 codename Gob Bluth)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on localhost:4567, CTRL+C to stop
```

That means you'll have access to it on http://localhost:4567.
