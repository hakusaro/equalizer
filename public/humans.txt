/* WHY */

The problem is simple: Only 1 in 5 computer programmers are women.

In a world where technology rules our lives, now, more than ever, is the time to equalize the statistics.

From our smartphones to our future self driving cars, leaving such a wide gap isn’t just about fairness in employment.

It’s about diversifying software and hardware, from development to implementation.
