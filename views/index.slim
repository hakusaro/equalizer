              | Born in the early 1800s, Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace, is universally regarded as the first Computer Scientist and Programmer. Her work took place on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer. Her mother, Anne Isabella Milbanke attempted to developer her interest in logic and math in an effort to distance her from her father, George Gordon Byron. Her mother's efforts to get Ada interested in logic and mathematics worked. Ada, however, still maintained a strong connection to her father until her death.
            p style="text-align: left;"
              | Ada annotated an article by Luigi Menabrea. Luigi's article, translated from Italian, was written on mechanical engines. In her <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes</span>, Ada wrote out what historians consider to be the first computer algorithm.

              | Margaret Hamilton is a Computer Scientist, Systems Engineer, and business owner. She studied mathematics at University of Michigan early in life. In 1960, she began an internship at MIT developing software for predicting weather. In 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies.
            p style="text-align: left;"
              | Hamilton is pictured on the right next to her most famous accomplishment: the source code for the Apollo Guidance Computer. On November 22nd, 2016, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
            p style="text-align: left;"
              | Her fault-tolerant scheduler design in the Apollo Guidance Computer allowed it to recover from a potentially fatal overload during Apollo 11.
            p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px"
              | "[The AGC] sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut, 'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., [only] the ones needed for landing."

            p style="text-align: left"
              | Grace Hopper was a Computer Scientist and a US Navy Rear Admiral. In 1944, she was one of the first to program on the Harvard Mark I computer. She is recognized for several things: the creation of the first compiler, the notion of machine-independent programming languages, and for coining the term bug. Her work led to the creation of COBOL, a machine-independent language.
            p
              | On November 22nd, 2016, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously for her work.
            p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 20px"
              | "The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances."

              | Dame Stephanie "Steve" Shirley is a British IT business owner who started Freelance Programmers, a software company, in 1962. While she initially avoided university, she took evening classes to earn a degree with honors in mathematics as she built computers from parts and wrote machine code at the Post Office Research Station.
            p style="text-align: left;"
              | In order to become more successful, Stephanie changed her name to 'Steve' to compete in the business world. At Freelance Programmers, she aimed to create job opportunities for women, and employed predominantly women with only three of the first 300 staff members being male.
            p style="text-align: center;"
              | Stephanie <a href="http://www.steveshirley.com/">maintains her own website</a>, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftow7dSpaiY">spoken at the TED conference</a>, and currently lives a life of philanthropy.

            | Though Lois loved computers as a kid, she didn't think it was career worthy until she wanted to leave Electrical Engineering. She loves how unique Computer Science is, in that any given problem can have many different solutions.
          p class="story_quote" style="font-size: 15px !important"
